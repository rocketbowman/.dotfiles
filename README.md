# Dotfiles

This is my attempt at a systematized approach to dotfiles. Basically, keep everything in 
a single Git repository. Use GNU Stow to create symlinks to the main directory where your 
OS expects to find the dotfiles.

Eventually, I want to use org-mode + org-babel to create literate config files.
